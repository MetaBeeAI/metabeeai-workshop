Following this I worked for 10 years as a reporting officer with the Forensic Science Service.  I Joined the Chemicals Regulation Division (CRD), HSE in 2013 and have worked in the ecotoxicology team since then – working on pesticide and biocide active substance and product registrations. Attended some EFSA peer review meetings pre EU-exit.  Work on all ecotoxicology areas of risk assessment and have an interest in bees.

The AIBIO vision is to bring together AI and core bioscience researchers to unravel biological fundamentals and tackle impeding societal challenges. To do this, we run events, and fund activities and pilot projects, to bring new members of the community together. In this talk we will look at some relevant applications of AI in the Biosciences, and consider the state of AI capabilities at the current time, in particular computer vision and large language models. An introduction to AIBIO-UK will be included; AIBIO-UK is a BBSRC community building network to bring together the AI and biosciences communities.",

Since 2002, my research activity focuses on ecology and conservation of bees in the agroecosystems and the valorisation of the pollination service. In particular, I study the impacts of the environmental stressors (mainly pesticides) on bee health following a holistic approach. This approach, which includes the assessment of potential synergistic effects among different stressors in laboratory and the analysis of data gathered from field monitoring studies, aims to improve the current environmental risk assessment and pollinator health.",
