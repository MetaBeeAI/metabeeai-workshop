I have only recently become involved in ecotoxicological studies that investigate how pesticide exposure can alter insect behaviour. This is particularly interesting when it affects pollinators which have to accomplish a complex set of behaviours to successfully pollinate a flower."},

I use approaches from neuroscience to study bees sensory responses to floral rewards and combine respirometry with automated behaviour tracking to study the effects of larval exposure to stressors on metabolism."},

I would define myself as a bee ecologist. Since 2002, my research activity focuses on ecology and conservation of bees in the agroecosystems and the valorisation of the pollination service. In particular, I study the impacts of the environmental stressors (mainly pesticides) on bee health following a holistic approach. This approach, which includes the assessment of potential synergistic effects among different stressors in laboratory and the analysis of data gathered from field monitoring studies, aims to improve the current environmental risk assessment and pollinator health."},

Some of my work has focussed on the impacts of pesticides (insecticides, fungicides and herbicides) on bee behaviour, reproduction and delivery of pollination services to crops. Increasingly, I'm interested in mitigation measures that can limit impacts of pesticides on pollinators."},

My research aims to understand the mechanisms underlying wild bee declines and how environmental stressors affect wild bee health. Key interests are studying the interactions among agricultural pesticides and relevant pathogens as well as focusing on male insect reproductive health."},
